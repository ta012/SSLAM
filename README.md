# üîä [ICLR 2025] SSLAM: Enhancing Self-Supervised Models with Audio Mixtures for Polyphonic Soundscapes

[![Conference Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/ICLR-2025-blue)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=odU59TxdiB)

üöÄ **SSLAM** is a self-supervised learning framework designed to enhance audio representation quality for both **polyphonic(multiple overlapping sounds)** and monophonic soundscapes. Unlike traditional SSL models that focus on monophonic data, SSLAM introduces a novel **source retention loss** and **audio mixture training**, significantly improving performance on real-world polyphonic audio.

## üîç Why SSLAM?
üîä **Real-world audio is polyphonic**‚Äîmultiple overlapping sound sources are common in everyday environments.  
‚ùå **Existing SSL models focus on monophonic audio,** limiting their ability to generalize to real-world scenarios. Their benchmarks are primarily monophonic, and their pre-training does not account for polyphonic environments.   
üí° **SSLAM bridges this gap** by introducing **self-supervised learning from audio mixtures**, enabling robust learning across **both monophonic and polyphonic soundscapes**.

## üéº Key Features
‚úÖ **Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM)** ‚Äì improving robustness to real-world polyphonic audio  (multiple overlapping sounds).  
‚úÖ **Source Retention Loss** ‚Äì ensures the integrity of each sound source even in complex mixtures.  
‚úÖ **SOTA Performance** ‚Äì Achieves **+3.9% mAP improvement** on AudioSet-2M and **+9.1% on polyphonic datasets**.

## **üõ†Ô∏èInference Mode**
> **Note**: If you are already using [EAT](https://github.com/cwx-worst-one/EAT/tree/main) in your evaluation/inference pipeline, you can simply replace the weights with SSLAM weights, as the inference and evaluation code is identical to EAT.

If not, follow the steps below for installation:
## üì• Inference Installation

```bash
conda create --prefix /path/to/sslam_eval_env -y python=3.9.13
/path/to/sslam_eval_env/bin/python -m pip install pip==24.0 # downgrade pip
/path/to/sslam_eval_env/bin/pip install -r SSLAM_Inference/requirements_sslam_eval.txt
```

#### üöÄ **Using SSLAM**

We provide scripts to use SSLAM in the following ways:

##### 1. **Audio Feature (Representation) Extraction Using SSLAM Encoder**

```bash
cd SSLAM_Inference/scripts
bash feature_extract.sh
```

##### 2. **Inference on Single Audio WAV File**

```bash
cd SSLAM_Inference/scripts
bash inference.sh
```

##### 3. **Evaluation on AudioSet-2M Evaluation Set**

```bash
cd SSLAM_Inference/scripts
bash evaluate_AS2M_finetuned.sh # Reported mAP: 50.2
```
